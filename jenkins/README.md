# Quick Start

The quickest way to get start is [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  

`cd jenkins;docker-compose up -d`  

# Tips:

* if you can't start up successfully, sometimes you shoud chown of the mounted dir to `jenkins:jenkins`.
* you can change the docker-compose.yml to mount what you want.
